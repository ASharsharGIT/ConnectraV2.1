## 🎯 CSS LOAD ORDER (CRITICAL!)

**This order MUST be maintained:**

```html
<!-- 1. Base styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

<!-- 2. Animations -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animations.css">

<!-- 3. Responsive -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/responsive.css">

<!-- 4. FIXES (MUST BE LAST!) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/fixes.css">

<!-- 5. Page-specific (About page only) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/about-styles.css">
```

⚠️ **WARNING:** If `fixes.css` doesn't load last, the cursor might still be invisible!
